## Machine Learning Track Tasks
#### This repository contains the tasks and projects I completed during my Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy InfoTech in September 2024. These projects focus on regression, clustering, and classification, applying various machine learning and deep learning techniques to real-world datasets.
### Overview
#### During this internship, I successfully completed the following tasks:
#### Task 1: Linear Regression for Housing Price Prediction
#### Task 2: Mall Customers Clustering Using K-Means
#### Task 3: Binary Classification Using SVM and VGG16
#### Task 4: Hand Gesture Recognition Using CNN
#### Task 5: Fruits Multi-Classification Using CNN

### Tasks Details
#### 1. Linear Regression for Housing Price Prediction 
##### - Imported required libraries and loaded the dataset.
##### - Explored and cleaned the dataset, addressing null values and outliers.
##### - Converted categorical features into numeric values and plotted feature correlations.
##### - Split the dataset into train and test sets, visualized them, and trained a Linear Regression model.
##### - Achieved an accuracy of 69.93% and plotted the best-fit line for predictions.

#### 2. Mall Customers Clustering Using K-Means
##### - Loaded and preprocessed the dataset, visualizing features using box plots.
##### - Applied the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k = 5).
##### - Built a K-means clustering model and visualized cluster points and centroids.

#### 3. Binary Classification Using SVM and VGG16
##### - Loaded a dataset of cat and dog images (from Kaggle), resized them to 224x224, and normalized them.
##### - Split data into training and testing sets, encoded labels, and visualized the data.
##### - Used the VGG16 pre-trained model (with ImageNet weights) for feature extraction.
##### - Trained an SVM model with a linear kernel (C=10) and achieved an accuracy of 77%.
##### - Visualized predictions, plotted a confusion matrix, and generated a classification report.

#### 4. Hand Gesture Recognition Using CNN
##### - Loaded a hand gesture dataset (from Kaggle), resized images to 224x224, and normalized them.
##### - Visualized datasets (training and testing) and analyzed class distribution using pie and bar charts.
##### - Built a CNN model and trained it using the categorical cross-entropy loss function.
##### - Achieved an accuracy of 99.9% with a loss of 0.003.
##### - Generated a classification report, plotted a confusion matrix, and visualized predictions.

#### 5. Fruit Multi-Classification Using CNN 
##### - Loaded a fruit dataset (from Kaggle) for training, testing, and validation, resized to 224x224, and normalized the images.
##### - Visualized datasets and analyzed class distribution with pie and bar charts.
##### - Built and trained a CNN model using the categorical cross-entropy loss function.
##### - Achieved an accuracy of 61.11% with a loss of 1.09.
##### - Generated a classification report, plotted a confusion matrix, and visualized model performance.
